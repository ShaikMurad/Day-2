Different between document and window object:

Document object:
The document object represents a web page that is loaded in the browser. By accessing the document object, we can access the element in the HTML page. With the help of document objects, we can add dynamic content to our web page. The document object can be accessed with a window.document or just document.

2. It is loaded inside the window.
3. It is the object of window property.
4. All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.
5. We can access the document from a window using the window.document.
6. Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed by a window like this window.document.title

Window object:
The window object is the topmost object of the DOM hierarchy. It represents a browser window or frame that displays the contents of the webpage. Whenever a window appears on the screen to display the contents of the document the window object is created.
